I remember a news cast in danish tv dr1 regarding some programming issues.
Quite some years back.
And the journalists asked the official programmer, probably a computer scientist
how he would do TOH, and then he scribbled something on papar and made a working
model of it. They filmed his methods how he did it in handwriting, but i guess
that must have been the recursive model he came up with.
