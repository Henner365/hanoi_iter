# hanoi_iter
I (try to) commit from VS22 IDE.

most considerations and reasoning is in the consideration branch.

What seems to be the problem ?

I found a working class structure , to implement a replica of the stack behavour in a in order tower of hanoi solution.
I noticed in isbn 0-13-852872-1, prentice hall , Andrew S. Tanenbaum : structured computer organization, 3. edition , problems chap. 5. page 317 , prob 33 ;

if you are not convinced that recursion is at time indispensable, try programming the towers of hanoi without recursion 
and without simulating the recursive solution by maintaining a stack in an array. Be warned however,
that you will probably not be able to find the solution.

I remember a news cast in danish tv dr1 regarding some programming issues.
Quite some years back.
And the journalists asked the official programmer, probably a computer scientist
how he would do TOH, and then he scribbled something on papar and made a working
model of it. They filmed his methods how he did it in handwriting, but i guess
that must have been the recursive model he came up with.
