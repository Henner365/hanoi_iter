most considerations and reasoning is in the _ branch.

I found a working class structure , to implement a replica of the stack behavour in a in order tower of hanoi solution.
I noticed in isbn 0-13-852872-1, prentice hall , Andrew S. Tanenbaum : structured computer organization, 3. edition , problems chap. 5. page 317 , prob 33 ;

if you are not convinced that recursion is at time indispensable, try programming the towers of hanoi without recursion 
and without simulating the recursive solution by maintaining a stack in an array. Be warned however,
that you will probably not be able to find the solution.
