# Tower_Of_Hanoi_iter


I remember a news cast in danish television dr1 regarding some programming issues.
Quite some years back.
And the journalists asked the official programmer, probably a computer scientist
how he would do TOH, and then he scribbled something on papar and made a working
model of it. They filmed his methods how he did it in handwriting, but i guess
that must have been the recursive model he came up with.

;)

I have advanced quite a bit on this program.
Or i was stuck for some time with the theory b4.
Now i have the theory in place.
I have explained it metimeticulously here :
